OOP Design

My project definitely calls for OOP as the scanning tool effectively models the network. Below is a UML diagram to visualise my objects and their relationships.  
The network profile is made up of device objects and a user object **(composition)**. Gary will be able to select which network profile is used, and therefore what devices are already known.  
The devices class has two child classes **(inheritance/generalisation)** which inherit its attributes and methods. These also have scanning operations/methods, and the ping method is overridden the the Unknown Device child class **(overiding polymorphism)**. This is so that the known devices can have a quick TCP SYN Scan connection on a known open port, instead of a standard ICMP ping which all other devices would recieve. If the device does not respond to the port ping, then the scan falls back to ICMP to check if the service has stopped, or if the device is offline.
